=head1 NAME

CGI::Application::Plugin::AutoRunmode - CGI::App plugin to automatically register runmodes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Using subroutine attributes:

	package MyApp;
	use base 'CGI::Application';
	use CGI::Application::Plugin::AutoRunmode;
	
	sub my_run_mode : StartRunmode {
		# do something here
	}
	
	sub another_run_mode : Runmode {
		# do something else
	}
	
	# you now have two run modes
	# "my_run_mode" and "another_run_mode"
	# "my_run_mode" is the start (default) run mode


Declare that every method in a (delegate) class is a run mode. 

  	package MyAppRunmodes;
	# the delegate class
		sub my_run_mode  {
			my ($app, $delegate) = @_;
				# do something here
		}
	    
		sub another_run_mode  {
				# do something else
		}
		
	package MyApp;
   	use base 'CGI::Application';
	   
		sub setup{
			my ($self) = @_;
			my $delegate = 'MyAppRunmodes';
				# $delegate can be a class name or an object
			$self->param('::Plugin::AutoRunmode::delegate' => $delegate);
		}
	
	 # you now have two run modes
	 # "my_run_mode" and "another_run_mode"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin for CGI::Application provides easy
ways to setup run modes. You can just write
the method that implement a run mode, you do
not have to explicitly register it with CGI::App anymore.

There are two approaches: 

=over 4

=item Declare run modes with subroutine attributes. 

You can flag methods in
your CGI::App subclass with the attribute "Runmode" or "StartRunmode" (these
attributes are case-insensitive)

=item Declare that every method in a class is a run mode.

You can assign a
delegate object, all whose methods will become runmodes 

You can also mix both approaches.

Delegate runmodes receive two parameters: The first one is the CGI::App
instance, followed by the delegate instance or class name. This can be useful
if you have delegate objects that contain state.

It is possible to chain multiple delegates by specifying an array reference
containing the delegate instances or class names. This chain is
checked from left to right and the runmode will be delegated to the first match.

=back

It both cases, the resulting runmodes will have the same
name as the subroutine that implements them. They are activated
by a cgiapp_prerun hook provided by this plugin (if 
you are using CGI::Application older than version 4, hooks
are not available, and you can import a cgiapp_prerun method
instead).


=head2 EXPORT

This module needs to export some symbols to do 
its job.

First of all, there are the handlers for the Runmode 
attribute.

In addition to that, the cgiapp_prerun hook is installed
in your application class.
This is not done as an export per se, but the hook installation 
is still
done in the import subroutine. Sound confusing, is confusing,
but you do not really need to know what is going on exactly,
just keep in mind that in order to let things go on, you
have to "use" the module with the default exports:

	use CGI::Application::Plugin::AutoRunmode;

and not

	use CGI::Application::Plugin::AutoRunmode ();
		# this will disable the Runmode attributes
		# DO NOT DO THIS
		

You can also explicitly import the cgiapp_prerun method.
This will disable the installation of the hook.
Basically, you only want to do this if you are using
CGI::Application prior to version 4, where hooks are
not supported.

	use CGI::Application::Plugin::AutoRunmode 
		qw [ cgiapp_prerun];
		# do this if you use CGI::Application version 3.x




=head2 How does it work?

After CGI::App has determined the name of the
run mode to be executed in the normal way, 
cgiapp_prerun checks if such a run mode exists
in the map configured by $self->run_modes().

If the run mode already exists, it gets executed
normally (this module does nothing). This means
that you can mix the ways to declare run modes
offered by this plugin with the style provided 
by core CGI::App.

If that is not the case, it tries to find a method
of the same name
in the application class (or its superclasses)
that has been flagged as a Runmode.
If it finds one, it augments the mapping with
a subroutine reference to that method.

If that step fails, it looks if a delegate has been
defined and searches the methods of that delegate
object for one that matches the name of the runmode.

The runmode can then be executed by CGI::App
as if it had been set up by $self->run_modes()
in the first place.

=head3 The run mode called "start"

Note that because the plugin only gets activated
when you call a run mode that is not registered
in the usual run mode map, you cannot use it to
create a run mode called C<< start >>. The CGI:App base
class always registers a run mode of that name.


=head2 Does it still work if I change the run mode in cgiapp_prerun ?


If you have a cgiapp_prerun method and change the run mode
there, the installed hook will not be able to catch it
(because of the ordering of hooks).

So, if you do that, you have to explicitly make this call
before returning from cgiapp_prerun:
	
   CGI::Application::Plugin::AutoRunmode::cgiapp_prerun($self);

Again, this is only necessary if you change the run mode
(to one that needs the auto-detection feature).

Also, this kind of code can be used with CGI::App 3.x
if you have a cgiapp_prerun.

=head2 StartRunmode

The attribute StartRunmode designates that subroutine to 
be the start (default) run mode. If you use this feature,
the "traditional" way of setting the start run mode (calling
C<< $self->start_mode('name') >>) is disabled and can no longer
be used in this application (including subclasses and instance
scripts).

=head2 ErrorRunmode

The attribute ErrorRunmode designates that subroutine to 
be the error run mode. If you use this feature,
the "traditional" way of setting the error run mode (calling
C<< $self->error_mode('name') >>) is disabled and can no longer
be used in this application (including subclasses and instance
scripts). This feature requires CGI::App of at least version 3.30.

Note that this "error run mode" is not a run mode that 
is directly accessible using its name as a query parameter.
It will only be dispatched to internally if the original
run mode produced an error. This is exactly how plain
CGI:App C<< error_mode >> behaves as well (you could still
declare the method to also be a C<< :Runmode >> ).

=head2 A word on security

The whole idea of this module (to reduce code complexity
by automatically mapping a URL
to a subroutine that gets executed) is a potential 
security hazard and great care has to be 
taken so that a remote user cannot run 
code that you did not intend them to.

In order to prevent a carefully crafted URL to access
code in other packages, this module disallows non-word
characters (such as : )  in run mode names.

Also, you have to make sure that when using a delegate
object, that it (and its superclasses) only contain
run modes (and no other subroutines).

The following run mode names are disallowed
by this module:

	can isa VERSION AUTOLOAD new DESTROY


=head2 Effect on the run_modes map

This module only inserts the current run mode into the
run_mode map (unless it is already in there). It does not
place any other :Runmodes there. As a result of this 
behaviour, users of AutoRunmode will most likely find the
run mode map almost completely empty. This can lead to
strange results if you expect a more complete list of possible run modes
there. At this time, there is no workaround for this.
Feel free to complain to the author if you have a requirement here.

It is possible, however, to query the AutoRunmode plugin if
an AutoRunmode exists for a given name.

  my $check = CGI::Application::Plugin::AutoRunmode::is_auto_runmode($self, $name)

This function returns a code ref if such an AutoRunmode exists.
