CGI/Application/Plugin/AutoRunmode version 0.06
===============================================

This plugin for CGI::Application provides easy
ways to setup run modes. You can just write
the methods that implement a run mode, you do
not have to explicitly register it with CGI::App anymore.

There are two approaches: You can flag methods
in your CGI::App subclass with the attribute "Runmode",
or you can assign a delegate object, all whose methods
will become runmodes (you can also mix both approaches).

A third approach is to use a delegate object that
delegates to Perl source files on disk, an implementation
of which is included herein.
